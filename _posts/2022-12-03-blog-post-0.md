Welcome to my blog! Lots more to come.  
I've just set up my website from the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), and I think it was quite simple to set up.  
I followed the readme and filled out my info, uploaded a couple pictures, then got to work on the markdown files. I added the markdown files for teaching, which just have a small description of the course info and the textbook. Then I added some talks. I still have more talks to go, but this is a good start.  
The RSS feed I believe is set up, and the [first episode of the JCP](https://rss.com/podcasts/joecrowley/730137/) is available to stream now.
