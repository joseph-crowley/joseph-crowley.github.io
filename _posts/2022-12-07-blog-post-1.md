Here's a basic sketch of how b-quarks are tagged at the LHC. A displaced secondary vertex with jets O(mm) away from the primary vertex is reconstructed from the silicon detectors centimeters from the colliding beams of protons.  
  
Surprisingly, the b-quark, or beauty quark, is relatively long lived. With a lifetime O(ps) and relativistic time-dilation factor $$\gamma \approx 10$$ the B hadrons travel O(mm) before decaying into jets. The experimental signature for b's is a jet from the primary vertex as well as a secondary vertex from the b decay.
