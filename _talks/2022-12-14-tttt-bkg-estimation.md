Update on performing skims, producing a control region to isolate tt+bb+jj. [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10hZi1-N3RtKkHh7JqIQKIOfBBo7uW8OmwbW_ZYMnEsg/edit?usp=sharing)  

why study jet multiplicity?
=========

4 bâ€™s are a key aspect of the tttt signal. tt+bb+cc+jj looks a lot like signal, so the MC must model this well, in order for us to kill the bkg. eventually we will train a new BDT with updated lepton ID and btagging.
