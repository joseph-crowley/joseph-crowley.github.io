This was a challenge due, of course, to the pandemic. I worked from my parents house in sonoma county, remoting in via zoom to teach an electronics lab course for upper division UCSB physics students. Breadboarding and debugging over zoom posed a significant challenge due to low resolution cameras operating in low light circumstances. Students and teaching assistants were shipped electronics kits that enabled them to participate fully in an analog electronics lab with electrical
components, oscilloscopes, and digital multimeters.
